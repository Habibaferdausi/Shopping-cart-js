# Shopping cart


A shopping cart using JavaScript and DOM is a web-based application that allows users to add and remove items from a virtual shopping cart. This project uses JavaScript to handle the user input and DOM manipulation to display the shopping cart contents and update the cart total.

To build this project, I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
